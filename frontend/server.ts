/**
 * Copilot Runtime for this harness.
 *
 * Shape comes from the Angular quickstart's Node runtime server
 * (https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/strands-typescript/quickstart), with the agent
 * bound to the AWS Strands backend in `../backend` — the Angular/AWS Strands
 * quickstart defers the backend step to "register this backend as the
 * `default` agent".
 *
 * That backend exposes a plain AG-UI endpoint — `createStrandsApp(aguiAgent,
 * { path: "/" })` in backend/main.ts mounts a single `POST /` that streams
 * AG-UI events over SSE. The quickstart's runtime snippet binds it with the generic
 * `HttpAgent` from `@ag-ui/client`, so that is the binding here too; there is
 * no AWS Strands-specific server-side wrapper to import.
 *
 * `default` and `support` resolve to the same AWS Strands process. `support`
 * exists so the doc snippets that use `agentId="support"` (Chat UI, Threads)
 * run verbatim. `my_agent` and `research-agent` exist for the same reason, for
 * the Copilot Runtime and AG-UI pages respectively.
 *
 * `a2ui: {}` enables A2UIMiddleware for every registered agent, per
 * https://docs.copilotkit.ai/angular/strands-typescript/guides/a2ui

 * load that file itself before constructing the Intelligence client.
 *
 * `process.loadEnvFile` is Node's own loader (>= 20.12; this project runs
 * Node 24), so it adds no dependency and needs no npm script — both
 * `package.json` and `node --env-file` were unavailable here. The path is
 * resolved from `import.meta.url` so it does not depend on the cwd, and the
